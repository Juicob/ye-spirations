"
445,"The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
"
446,"Today, I seriously thought about killing you
"
447,"I contemplated, premeditated murder
"
448,"And I think about killing myself
"
449,"And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
"
450,"Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
"
451,"You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
"
452,"The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
"
453,"(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
"
454,"Just say it out loud to see how it feels
"
455,"People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
"
456,"Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
"
457,"Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
"
458,"Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
"
459,"I think about killing myself
"
460,"And I, I love myself way more than I love you
"
461,"The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
"
462,"(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
"
463,"I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
"
464,"But sometimes I think really bad things
"
465,"Really, really, really bad things
"
466,"And I love myself way more than I love you
"
467,"See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
"
468,"I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
"
469,"Because that seems like a common theme
"
470,"But that's not the case here
"
471,"I love myself way more than I love you
"
472,"And I think about killing myself
"
473,"So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
"
474,"Premeditated murder
"
475,"I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
"
476,"I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb

"
5306,"Do you think about me now and then?
"
5307,"'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
"
5308,"-Min' home again
"
5309,"I met this girl when I was three years old
"
5310,"And what I loved most, she had so much soul
"
5311,"She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
"
5312,"But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
"
5313,"And from that point, I never blow her off
"
5314,"Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
"
5315,"They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
"
5316,"And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
"
5317,"And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
"
5318,"In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
"
5319,"I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
"
5320,"She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
"
5321,"She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
"
5322,"Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
"
5323,"I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
"
5324,"She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""
"
5325,"I'm comin' home again
"
5326,"Do you think about me now and then?
"
5327,"Do you think about me now and then?
"
5328,"'Cause I'm comin' home again
"
5329,"-Min' home again
"
5330,"Do you think about me now and then?
"
5331,"Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
"
5332,"Now I'm comin' home again
"
5333,"Maybe we can start again
"
5334,"But if you really cared for her
"
5335,"Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
"
5336,"Sometimes I still talk to her
"
5337,"But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
"
5338,"She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
"
5339,"They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
"
5340,"But they just not you,"" and I just got through
"
5341,"Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
"
5342,"Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
"
5343,"I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
"
5344,"I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
"
5345,"And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
"
5346,"Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
"
5347,"Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
"
5348,"Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
"
5349,"If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
"
5350,"I'm comin' home again
"
5351,"Do you think about me now and then?
"
5352,"Do you think about me now and then?
"
5353,"'Cause I'm comin' home again
"
5354,"-Min' home again
"
5355,"Baby, do you remember when
"
5356,"Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
"
5357,"Now I'm comin' home again
"
5358,"-Min' home again
"
5359,"Baby, do you remember when
"
5360,"Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
"
5361,"Now I'm comin' home again
"
5362,"Maybe we can start again
"
5363,"Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
"
5364,"Comin' home again
"
5365,"Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
"
5366,"Comin' home again
"
5367,"Maybe we can start again
"
5368,"Stadium status
"
5369,"My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
"
5370,"Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
"
5371,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
"
5372,"No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
"
5373,"It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
"
5374,"Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
"
5375,"Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
"
5376,"You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
"
5377,"J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
"
5378,"Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
"
5379,"Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
"
5380,"Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
"
5381,"With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
"
5382,"At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
"
5383,"But he got me out my momma crib
"
5384,"Then he help me get my momma a crib
"
5385,"Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
"
5386,"Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
"
5387,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
"
5388,"No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
"
5389,"Let the story begin
"
5390,"If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
"
5391,"Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
"
5392,"Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
"
5393,"'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
"
5394,"And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
"
5395,"I'd play my little songs in that old back room
"
5396,"He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
"
5397,"But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
"
5398,"Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
"
5399,"Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
"
5400,"And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
"
5401,"Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
"
5402,"Carline told me I could buy two tickets
"
5403,"I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
"
5404,"And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
"
5405,"But everything that I felt was more bogus
"
5406,"Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
"
5407,"Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
"
5408,"I guess I'll understand when I get more older
"
5409,"Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
"
5410,"Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
"
5411,"My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
"
5412,"Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
"
5413,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
"
5414,"No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
"
5415,"Let the story begin
"
5416,"If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
"
5417,"Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
"
5418,"Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
"
5419,"The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
"
5420,"I was always on the other side of the peephole
"
5421,"Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
"
5422,"And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
"
5423,"But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
"
5424,"On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
"
5425,"Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
"
5426,"Sibling rivalry, only I could see
"
5427,"It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
"
5428,"At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
"
5429,"But my big brother who I always tried to be
"
5430,"When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
"
5431,"Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
"
5432,"I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
"
5433,"And my shit was more like a finger roll
"
5434,"But I had them singles though
"
5435,"And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
"
5436,"I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
"
5437,"Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
"
5438,"Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
"
5439,"Translate, español: ""No way, José""
"
5440,"Then I went and told Jay Brown
"
5441,"Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
"
5442,"Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
"
5443,"But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
"
5444,"My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
"
5445,"So here's a few words from ya kid brother
"
5446,"If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
"
5447,"People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
"
5448,"A idol in my eyes, god of the game
"
5449,"Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
"
5450,"Never be the same, never be another
"
5451,"Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother
"
5452,"My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
"
5453,"Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
"
5454,"Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
"
5455,"No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends
"
5456,"Toomp killed this shit
"
5457,"I'm not sure anymore, more
"
5458,"Who is knocking at my door, door
"
5459,"All the faces that I know

"
5464,"I'm just gon' say good night
"
5465,"Uh

5466,"Good night
"
5467,"Right now I can see it so vivid
"
5468,"Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it
"
5469,"Me and my grandparents on a field trip
"
5470,"And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
"
5471,"But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
"
5472,"Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph
"
5473,"Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
"
5474,"Man (man), I wouldn't let a moment pass
"
5475,"What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
"
5476,"What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
"
5477,"What do it mean when you never dream at all then
"
5478,"And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
"
5479,"It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
"
5480,"People you never got a chance to say bye to
"
5481,"Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
"
5482,"Into real life (real life), if you try to
"
5483,"So close (so close), but so far (but so far)
"
5484,"And so far (and so far), no cigar (no cigar)
"
5485,"We can't dwell on the past, all we got is today
"
5486,"So I'ma live like it's no tomorrow, no goodbyes

"
5527,"We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says

"
5529,"And she claims she only with me for the currency
"
5530,"You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery

"
5532,"I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
"
5533,"We breaking up again, we making up again
"
5534,"But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
"
5535,"Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
"
5536,"And you mix them emotions with tequila
"
5537,"And you mix that with a little bad advice
"
5538,"On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
"
5539,"And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
"
5540,"And she say, ""Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch""
"
5541,"You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
"
5542,"I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
"
5543,"But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man

"
5557,"And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
"
5558,"Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
"
5559,"And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
"
5560,"But I can't even vibe with you sexually
"

"
5562,"Saying, ""You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
"
5563,"You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
"
5564,"You don't see how our life was supposed to be?

"
5843,"He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
"
5844,"Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
"
5845,"And walked around the mall with his radio face off
"
5846,"Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
"
5847,"Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
"
5848,"Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
"
5849,"Drove by the teachers, even more by polices

"
5856,"See back-back then-then, if you had a car
"
5857,"You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
"
5858,"And I was just a virgin, a baby
"
5859,"One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
"
5860,"I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
"
5861,"Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
"
5862,"We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
"
5863,"They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
"
5864,"With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog

5875,"Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
"
5876,"I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies

5878,"It's a star-studded event when I valet park
"
5879,"Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
"
5880,"You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
"
5881,"The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
"
5882,"I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
"
5883,"But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
"
5884,"A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
"
5885,"Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
"
5886,"I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
"
5887,"I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

"
5901,"You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
"
5902,"That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)

5903,"I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
"
5904,"My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings

5921,"Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
"
5922,"Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
"
5923,"The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
"
5924,"Rubber band together in cashless bundles
"
5925,"We wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remains
"
5926,"Makin sense of it we hustle for change
"
5927,"Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin
"
5928,"Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
"
5929,"Hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell

"
6618,"I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
"
6619,"And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
"
6620,"And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
"
6621,"Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
"
6622,"But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
"
6623,"Now they asking Cons, how long has this gone on
"
6624,"And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
"
6625,"'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
"
6626,"So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
"
6627,"And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
"
6628,"And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
"
6629,"And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
"
6630,"But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
"
6631,"And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
"
6632,"But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
"
6633,"And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
"
6634,"And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
"
6635,"And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
"
6636,"And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes

"
6642,"And that make me wanna get my advance out
"
6643,"And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
"
6644,"Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
"
6645,"Kanye step away from the lime
"
6646,"Light like when I was on the grind
"
6647,"In the 1-9-9-9
"
6648,"Before model chicks was bending over
"
6649,"Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
"
6650,"Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
"
6651,"We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
"
6652,"What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?

"
6656,"Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
"
6657,"How we out in Europe, spending Euros
"
6658,"They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
"
6659,"I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
"
6660,"I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
"
6661,"Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
"
6662,"But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
"
6663,"You'll sell everything including the mannequin
"
6664,"They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
"
6665,"Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
"
6666,"Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
"

"
6668,"They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone""
"
6669,"Diamonds are forever

"
6679,"Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
"
6680,"Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
"
6681,"And I've realized that I've arrived
"
6682,"'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
"
6683,"Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
"
6684,"That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
"
6685,"Damn, is he really that caught up?
"
6686,"I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
"
6687,"I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
"
6688,"Or even a four-track recorder
"
6689,"So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
"
6690,"Spoil yourself, that's important
"
6691,"If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
"
6692,"Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
"
6693,"Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
"
6694,"I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—
"
6695,"Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)

6696,"Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
"
6697,"Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

7005,"Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr

"
7046,"We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
"
7047,"Things we buy to cover up what's inside
"
7048,"'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
"
7049,"That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
"
7050,"Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
"

7143,"Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
"
7144,"Yes, I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, stayin' low key, nope

"
7162,"This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
"
7163,"Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
"
7164,"No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
"
7165,"I had all that snatched from me
"
7166,"A&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me
"
7167,"And didn't want to hear a rap from me
"
7168,"So naturally actually had to face things factually
"
7169,"Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
"
7170,"'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
"
7171,"I don't wanna ever go back there
"
7172,"So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off
"
7173,"I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
"
7174,"I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

7178,"I said I want my chariot to pick me up
"
7179,"And take me, brother, for a ride
"

"
7190,"I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
"
7191,"Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
"
7192,"Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
"
7193,"Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
"
7194,"They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
"
7195,"Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""

"
7225,"Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
"
7226,"I know He hear me when my feet get weary
"
7227,"'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
"
7228,"We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
"
7229,"I ain't here to argue about His facial features
"
7230,"Or here to convert atheists into believers
"
7231,"I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
"
7232,"The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
"
7233,"So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
"
7234,"They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
"
7235,"That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
"
7236,"But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
"
7237,"Well if this take away from my spins
"
7238,"Which'll probably take away from my ends
"
7239,"Then I hope this take away from my sins
"
7240,"And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
"
7241,"Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out
"
7242,"(Jesus walk)
"
7243,"God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
"
7244,"(Jesus walk with me)
"
7245,"The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
"
7246,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
"
7247,"One thing I've found, one thing I found
"
7248,"Oh no, you'll never let me down
"
7249,"Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
"
7250,"Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
"
7251,"Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
"
7252,"Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
"
7253,"First I had they ear, now I have they heart
"
7254,"Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
"
7255,"I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
"
7256,"Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
"
7257,"I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
"
7258,"So when I reload, he holds number one position
"
7259,"When you hot, I'm hot
"
7260,"And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
"
7261,"It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
"
7262,"'cause I'ma be that nigga for life
"
7263,"This is not an image, this is God-given
"
7264,"This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
"
7265,"It's the most consistent, Hov
"
7266,"Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
"
7267,"Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
"
7268,"It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
"
7269,"I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy
"
7270,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
"
7271,"One thing I've found, one thing I found
"
7272,"Oh no, you'll never let me down
"
7273,"Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
"
7274,"Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
"
7275,"Get up, I get down, get up
"
7276,"I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
"
7277,"Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
"
7278,"At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
"
7279,"And with that in my blood I was born to be different
"
7280,"Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
"
7281,"But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
"
7282,"That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
"
7283,"Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
"
7284,"But I know they don't want me in the damn club
"
7285,"They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
"
7286,"I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
"
7287,"Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
"
7288,"But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
"
7289,"It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
"
7290,"Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
"
7291,"Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
"
7292,"So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
"
7293,"And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
"
7294,"And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
"
7295,"You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
"
7296,"But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
"
7297,"'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
"
7298,"First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
"
7299,"I know I got angels watching me from the other side
"
7300,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
"
7301,"One thing I've found, one thing I found
"
7302,"Oh no, you'll never let me down
"
7303,"Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
"
7304,"Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
"
7305,"Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
"
7306,"We are all here for a reason on a particular path
"
7307,"You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
"
7308,"Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
"
7309,"That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
"
7310,"I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
"
7311,"I'm not just another individual
"
7312,"My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
"
7313,"But I get my hymns from Him
"
7314,"So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
"
7315,"I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
"
7316,"My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
"
7317,"For your soul and your mental
"
7318,"That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
"
7319,"Yeah I need my loot by rent day
"
7320,"But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
"
7321,"I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
"
7322,"I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
"
7323,"Determination, dedication, motivation
"
7324,"I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
"
7325,"When I say I can't let you or self-down
"
7326,"If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
"
7327,"And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
"
7328,"In my grip, I would never ever let you down
"
7329,"And when these words are found
"
7330,"Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
"
7331,"With a language called love
"
7332,"That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
"
7333,"And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
"
7334,"I too dream in color and in rhyme
"
7335,"So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
"
7336,"'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
"
7337,"A touch of God reigns out
"
7338,"Take 'em to church
"
7339,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
"
7340,"One thing I found, one thing I found
"
7341,"Oh no, you'll never let me down
"
7342,"Get up, I get, get up, I get
"
7343,"Get up, I get, get up, I get
"
7344,"Get up, I get, get up, I get down
"
7345,"Who else you know been hot this long?
"
7346,"(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
"
7347,"Started from nothing but he got this strong
"
7348,"(The Roc is in the building)
"
7349,"Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
"
7350,"Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
"
7351,"Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
"
7352,"Well, somebody must have caught him
"
7353,"'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
"
7354,"Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
"
7355,"More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
"
7356,"Clear the way, I'm here to stay
"
7357,"Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
"
7358,"This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
"
7359,"When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
"
7360,"Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
"
7361,"Young the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
"
7362,"They way y'all all follow Jigga

8245,"This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas
"
8246,"(Mr. Rockefeller)
"
8247,"So get your ass up off the wall
"
8248,"So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
"
8249,"Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
"
8250,"Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
"
8251,"So won't you raise your glass won't you
"
8252,"So won't you raise your glass won't you
"
8253,"So won't you raise your glass won't you
"
8254,"So won't you raise your glass won't you
"
8255,"And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""
"
8256,"No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""
"
8257,"I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
"
8258,"I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
"
8259,"I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""
"
8260,"And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""
"
8261,"And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said
"
8262,"""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""
"
8263,"And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...
"
8264,"...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...
"
8265,"...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
"
8266,"And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""
"
8267,"""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""
"
8268,"You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""
"
8269,"That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...
"
8270,"I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
"
8271,"Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad
"
8272,"Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""
"
8273,"Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
"
8274,"""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
"
8275,"I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
"
8276,"You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""
"
8277,"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""
"
8278,"""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""
"
8279,"Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""
"
8280,"""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""
"
8281,"And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""
"
8282,"So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
"
8283,"So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
"
8284,"So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
"
8285,"So won't you raise your glass, won't you..."
